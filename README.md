# ft_strdup


This repository contains a custom implementation of the `strdup` function, named `ft_strdup`, which duplicates a string by allocating memory and copying the original string into the newly allocated space. Additionally, it includes helper functions `ft_len` for calculating the length of a string and `ft_strcpy` for copying strings. This project is aimed at those learning C programming, memory management, and string manipulation.

## Overview

The `ft_strdup` function demonstrates dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) and string manipulation in C. This function is often used in situations where a copy of a string is needed without altering the original string.

### Helper Functions

- `ft_len`: Calculates the length of a string.
- `ft_strcpy`: Copies a string from source to destination.
